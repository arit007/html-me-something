                    <p>
                        The axolotl (pronounced ACK-suh-LAH-thul) is a salamander but it is also known as the Mexican Walking Fish.
                        It is currently critically endangered. Since 2010, axolotls in the wild have been near extinction
                        because of the urbanization in Mexico City and water pollution to the nearby lakes they live in.
                        They are also sold as food in Mexican markets. Axolotls are used as a subject in scientific research due to them being able to regenerate lost limbs.

                    <p>
